# Project 2, CUinSPACE Simulated Flight
This program simulated a flight and/or flight races of potentially multiple different 
stored resources, events will occur and be printed when certain triggers are met. The
addition of resources, systems, events are all dynamically allocated and freed when no
longer in use. Due to multiple operations happening within a rocket at the same time,
to simulate this more accurately, multithreading was used to make such acts 
simultaneous and to decrease running time.

## Building and Running
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the program's files.
2. Type the command make
3. from the same directory, run './p2' to execute the project.
